# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.0

Major release — complete rebuild of the session management system and UI.

### Multi-Profile Sessions
- Monitor up to 5 concurrent AWS SSO profiles simultaneously
- Independent per-profile countdown timers, health checks, and refresh
- Proactive credential refresh when role credentials are within 15 minutes of expiry
- Automatic session restore on app launch

### New Menu Bar UI
- Replaced NSMenu with a floating NSPanel + SwiftUI interface
- Expandable profile rows showing region, account ID, and token expiry
- Per-profile connect, disconnect, and refresh controls inline
- Color-coded session status (green/red/gray)

### Phantom Session Fix
- Fixed incorrect SSO cache hash computation (now matches botocore: `sha1(sessionName)` for new-style configs, `sha1(startUrl)` for legacy)
- Dual-layer expiry tracking: monitors both role credentials (~1h) and SSO session tokens (~8h)
- Health checks detect dead sessions that still have time on the countdown


### Notifications
- Per-profile expiry warnings at configurable thresholds (1h, 30m, 10m, 5m, 1m)
- 60-second cooldown per profile to prevent notification spam
- Actionable "Refresh" button on notification banners

### App Icon
- New liquid glass icon designed with Icon Composer for macOS Sequoia

### Codebase
- 24% line-of-code reduction (7054 → 5382) with zero features removed
- Removed 5 orphaned files from prior UI architecture
- Consolidated duplicate managers into generic `JSONFileStore`
- Extracted shared ISO8601 date parsing across token managers
- Added `build.sh` for building from source without Xcode GUI
- Fixed App Support directory permission error when owned by root

### Breaking Changes
- Minimum macOS version raised to 15.2 (Sequoia)
